spotify-app (fall 2016)

This was a school project that I did in fall of 2016. The idea of this projects was to build a Music Information APP utilizing Live JSON API from Spotify. The objectives were:

-Implement a web page, where the user can select different artists from a list shown in page
-The page then shows the pictures and info of the albums of the artist
-Display some other info as well (songs of the album etc.)
-Create nice layout and style for the page
-Utilize jQuery for some nice effects etc.
-Extra points will be given for input field with custom search string

Overall in my opinion I did just fine. this was my first big project that I did alone so there are some flaws here and there. 

I succeeded in making the app work fine and I was able to fill all the objectives and I got a grade 5/5 from this (YEII!!). 

but many things could have been done better. I should have used bootstrap here but for some reason I wanted to do my own css styling which kind of worked but the code is pretty messy. My JS and HTMl code are also pretty wild and hard to understand but I will work on it.

Overall I learned alot form this project and I was able to recognize what my problems were and I will try to do better in the future.
